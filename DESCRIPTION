Description: The purpose of this package is to run the New York State 
    Department of Healthâ€™s Geographic Aggregation Tool (GAT) in R. GAT takes 
    an input shapefile and aggregates polygons based on user-defined numeric 
    values, then returns the new shapefile, the old shapefile with a crosswalk 
    attached, and other diagnostic information. See the vignettes and the 
    functions' help documentation for more details on how GAT works.
