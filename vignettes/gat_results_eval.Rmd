## GAT outputs

GAT generates and saves several files in the save folder defined by the user. Generated files fall into these categories:

* Crosswalk shapefile
* Aggregated shapefile
* PDF of plots
* Log
* Optionally, aggregated KML file

The crosswalk shapefile, which ends with "*in.shp", is identical to your input file with a few variables added to the table by GAT. These variables are noted in the log. Of interest in assessment is the variable GATflag, which identifies any areas excluded by the aggregation process. 

The aggregated shapefile is your final product. The variable GATid links the two shapefiles. Again, for assessment, the variable if interest is GATflag.

The plots may also indicate potential issues in your merge, depending on the selections you made. If relevant, the plots will highlight the following areas: 

* Excluded by user
* Below minimum aggregation value
* Above maximum aggregation value

The log includes all of your settings and a brief list of variables created by GAT, including a data dictionary for the GATflag variable, which corresponds with the highlighted areas displayed in the plots.

## Figuring out why areas were flagged

If you notice a lot of highlighted areas in places you do not expect, there are a few things you can do. First, review your settings. All settings are written to the log. Note especially aggregation minimum and maximum values, exclusion criteria, and boundary settings. In addition, the advanced setting `adjacent = TRUE` in the function options for `runGATprogram()` may cause unexpected behavior. These will be covered in the next few subsections.

### Areas excluded by the user

These areas meet one or more of the exclusion criteria you provided. They will be highlighted in **<span style='color: CornflowerBlue;'>blue-grey</span>** on the plots and labeled 1 in the variable GATflag in both shapefiles. Check that the areas you excluded were the areas you expected to exclude. Refer to the log or to the subtitle in the choropleth plots to verify how you defined your exclusion criteria.

### Areas above maximum value 

These areas had a value higher than your maximum value for *one or both* of your aggregation variables. They will be highlighted in **<span style='color: magenta;'>magenta</span>** on the plots and labeled 5 in the variable GATflag both shapefiles. Check that the areas highlighted are those you expected to have high values. 

GAT has no mechanism to include areas that meet some, but not all, exclusion criteria. For more complex exclusion rules, you should create a numeric boolean (e.g. 0 = true/include, 1 = false/exclude) prior to running your shapefile through GAT. Then use that boolean as your exclusion variable.

### Areas below minimum aggregation

These areas may have aggregated at least once, but did not aggregate enough to meet your minimum aggregation value for one or both aggregation variables. They will be highlighted in **<span style='color: cyan;'>cyan</span>** on the plots and labeled 10 in the variable GATflag in the aggregated shapefile. In general, any areas with GATflag = 10 are problematic. Before covering how to handle them, I will cover what might have caused them.

**Causes:** An area fails to aggregate to the minimum value because it has no neighbors elligible for aggregation. This is especially common, if you use the `adjacent = TRUE` setting, because it forces areas to aggregate only to areas that it physically touches. 

If you used `adjacent = TRUE`, which is the default setting in `runGATprogram()`, these situations can all cause areas to fail to aggregate to the minimum value. These situations hold true both within enforced boundaries (when an area cannot merge to areas outside its boundary at all) and when boundaries are not used.

1. The area is an island. It is not physically touching any other areas.
2. The area is isolated by excluded areas. For example, the area is the tip of a peninsula, but you excluded the peninsula's base or merging with the peninsula's base would cause the resulting area to surpass the maximum value for one or both aggregation variables.
3. The area is at the edge of the boundary and neighbors are not elligible. The area may be unable to merge to neighbors because they are excluded or because merging with them would cause the resulting area to surpass the maximum value for one or both aggregation variables.
4. The largest possible area is smaller than the minimum aggregation value. This occurs most commonly when using enforced boundaries, when all areas within the boundary merge into a single area, but the total for that area is still smaller than the minimum aggregation value for one or both aggregation variables.

If you manually set `adjacent = FALSE`, #4 above may still occur. In addition, a fifth situation is possible.

5. All neighbors within the boundary either were excluded or have high enough values for one or both aggregation variables that merging with them would cause one or both aggregation values in the resulting area to exceed the maximum aggregation values.

**Solutions:** Inspect the areas that were flagged and consider which issues above apply to your data. Review which settings are essential and which could be modified. The solutions you choose depend largely on your available shapefile and your ultimate goal. 

Most of these issues could be addressed in one of four ways. Whether any or all of these solutions are appropriate depends on what you are trying to do. You may want to try a few of them as well as changing merge settings before settling on a final solution. 

1. Use a shapefile with contiguous areas. Shapefiles that include cutouts for rivers, lakes, and shorelines are more likely to cause problems with aggregation, especially when using `adjacent = TRUE`.
2. If you do not need contiguous aggregated areas, use `adjacent = FALSE`. I do not recommend this in most cases, but it may be appropriate for your data and purpose.
3. Relax boundary restrictions. If you checked the box to enforce boundaries, but your task does not absolutely require that you remain within boundaries, try running the aggregation without checking that box. If you defined a boundary, GAT will still try to merge within that boundary before looking for neighbors outside it.
4. Increase or remove the restriction for maximum aggregation value. Consider the highest acceptable value or try running the aggregation without defining maximum aggregation values. After aggregation is complete, check the log for the ranges of values for each aggregation variable before and after aggregating.
