# Description

*By Thomas Talbot; revised and converted to Markdown by Abigail Stamm*

This package is maintained by the New York State Department of Health’s Environmental Public Health Tracking (EPHT) program. The purpose of this package is to run the Geographic Aggregation Tool (GAT) in R. 

Health outcome maps with fine geographic resolution can be misleading due to random fluctuations in disease rates caused by small numbers. In some cases these maps can also inadvertently disclose confidential data. To overcome these limitations EHS developed GAT to join neighboring geographic areas together until a user defined population and/or number of cases is reached. GAT can be used to produce maps for the public at the finest geographic resolution practicable.
    
The input object is a polygon shapefile. The shapefile must contain a character variable that uniquely identifies areas and a numeric variable to sum for aggregation. A series of dialog boxes allows the user to select: a variable to uniquely identify areas, one or more aggregation variables, optionally, a variable of areas within which merging will be preferred (ex. county), the amount (sum) the aggregation variable(s) should be aggregated to, and the preferred aggregation method - closest, least value, or ratio. The output is a shapefile with before and after choropleth maps in R graphics saved to PDF. For output regions, most numeric variables will be summed, except variables with the following names, which will be averaged instead: x, y, GATx, GATy, lat, lon, latitude, longitude, and long. For character variables, the values of the last region merged will be used, with three additional variables added: Sp_id for R row number and GATx, GATy for geographic centroids as determined by the GAT. 

The user must have an input shapefile (*.shp). The shapefile must have the geographic boundaries of the areas the user would like to merge, a character variable that uniquely identifies these areas, and a numeric variable to merge by, such as the number of cases of disease or the population.

GAT outputs a shapefile containing the aggregated regions with associated data, which can be used in GIS programs such as ArcGIS, MapInfo and QGIS. A KML file can also be produced, which can be displayed in Google Earth as well as other Internet-based mapping programs. Last, GAT outputs several before and after plots and a log of all selections and processes.

The package includes embedded map files to use when testing several of the package functions. For details, enter `?hftown` or `?hfpop` into the R console. 

# Technical Notes

## How GAT identifies areas to merge

*By Thomas Talbot; rewritten, reformatted, and converted to Markdown by Abigail Stamm; edited by Gwen Babcock*

The overall goal of the merging is to create a relatively large number of compact regions which meet the specified criteria. To accomplish this, the areas in the input shapefile are aggregated pairwise until all regions have the minimum values specified. 

### Selecting the target area

First, a subset of areas is selected the meets the following restrictions:

* Flagged areas removed (this includes areas indicated by exclusion criteria, with an aggregation value above the maximum, or with no mergeable neighbors)
* Areas with the values for both aggregation variables above minimum removed

This results in a subset of areas that all require merging. This subset is reordered from the highest values of the aggregation variable(s) to the lowest. If there is only one aggregation variable, the area with the highest value is merged first. If there is more than one aggregation variable, the process is more complicated. When two aggregation variables are selected, each aggregation variable is divided by the minimum value specified for it. The area with the highest proportion is selected to be aggregated first. 

> For example, given the following:
>
> * minimum for first aggregation variable: 1000 population
> * minimum for second aggregation variable: 100 births
> * first area: 200 population, 90 births
> * second area: 400 population, 50 births
>
> Calculate proportions of area value over minimum value for the first and second areas as follows: 
>
> * first area: $\frac{200 population}{1000 minimum population} = 0.2$, 
>   $\frac{90 births}{100 minimum births} = 0.9$  
>   maximum proportion = 0.9
> * second area: $\frac{400 population}{1000 minimum population} = 0.4$, 
>   $\frac{50 births}{100 minimum births} = 0.5$  
>   maximum proportion = 0.5
>
> Of these two areas, the first area has a higher maximum proportion, so it will be merged first.


### Identifying eligible neighbors

After the target area has been identified, GAT generates a list of its neighbors. Areas are considered neighbors if they share at least two points with the selected area. However, not all of these neighbors may be eligible for merging. GAT considers several criteria when selecting eligible areas.

* Always ineligible: Flagged areas, which includes areas indicated by exclusion criteria or with an aggregation value above the maximum. In addition, when merged, the resulting areas *cannot* have values above the maximum (target area value + merge area value $\ngtr$ maximum value).
* Adjacent: The default is for areas to merge only to adjacent areas. To override this, use the option `runGATprogram(adjacent=FALSE)`. This will result in adjacent areas being preferred, but not required. 
* Inside border: This option is selected in the dialogs. If you select a border, GAT will restrict neighbors only to areas within the border. If there are no eligible neighbors within the border and you used the option `adjacent = FALSE`, GAT will select the closest eligible area within the border, even if it is not adjacent. If you select a border and do not check the box to enforce the border, GAT will consider neighbors outside the border last.
* Value below minimum: The default is for GAT to ignore whether the values of neighbors are below the minimum aggregation value. If you want to merge areas whose values are below the minimum aggregation value first, use the option `runGATprogram(minfirst=TRUE)`. If there are no neighbors with aggregation values below the minimum value, GAT will recheck for neighbors without this restriction.

When relaxing eligibility restrictions, GAT drops criteria in this order: Value below minimum (if triggered by `minfirst = TRUE`), Adjacent (only if `adjacent = FALSE`), Inside border (only if if border not enforced). If no eligible areas are identified after relaxing restrictions, the target area is flagged as unable to merge further. For each area for which selection criteria were relaxed, a warning is written to the log.

### Selecting the most eligible neighbor

If the area does not have adjacent neighbors and you used `adjacency = FALSE`, GAT will default to the closest geographic centroid unless you chose population weighting, in which case it will use the closest population-weighted centroid.

If the area has more than one eligible adjacent neighbor, this is how the neighbor to merge is selected:

**Closest geographic centroid:** The target area is merged with the eligible area with the closest straight-line centroid based on the shape of the area. The new centroid is calculated by averaging the latitudes and longitudes of the two areas. 

**Closest population-weighted centroid:** The population file the user selected is used to determine the area's centroid based on the underlying population. The target area is merged with the eligible area with the closest population-weighted centroid. There are two methods for calculating the population-weighted centroid for the new area. The faster method, which is the default, is to calculate the proportion of the population each area contributes to the merged area, then multiply these proportions by their respective latitudes and longitudes and sum the results. For example, area A contributes 70% of the population and area B contributes 30% of the population. The new longitude would be 0.7 \* longitude$_A$ + 0.3 \* longitude$_B$. The slower method recalculates the centroid of the new area using the underlying populations of both areas in the population file. To access this method, use `runGATprogram(pwrepeat=TRUE)`.

**Least value:** If there is only one minimum value specified, the area with lowest value is selected. If there are two minimum values specified, the area with the lowest proportion of aggregation variable to minimum value specified is selected.

**Most similar:** The area with the least absolute difference between the ratios of the variables chosen for similarity comparison is merged with the selected area. For example, suppose the variables chosen for similarity comparison are counts of persons under poverty and total population. If the area to be merged has a percent under poverty of 10%, and it has neighbors have 9%, 13%, and 15% under poverty, then then it would be merged with the area with 9% under poverty. 

The new region then becomes a candidate for additional merging, and merging continues until all regions contain the minimum values of the aggregation variables specified or have been flagged as being unable to merge further.


## Thinning geographic boundaries

*By Thomas Talbot; revised and converted to Markdown by Abigail Stamm*

The program may merge very slowly if the geographic boundaries are unnecessarily complex. Boundaries can be simplified by a process known as “thinning” (or “simplification” or “integrating” or “generalizing”). Thinning is removing nodes based on how far apart they are and/or their collinearity to decrease the complexity of the maps (see figure below). GIS systems like MapInfo and ArcGIS can be used to thin maps. After thinning, areas should merge much more quickly in the GAT, but the map may appear crude. If high resolution maps are needed for display, the thinned map used for processing data can be linked back to the high resolution boundaries using unique area identifiers.

```{r nodespacing, out.width = '80%', fig.cap = 'Example of decreasing level of detail as nodes are thinned', echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/node_spacing.png")


```

## Compactness ratio

*By Abigail Stamm*

The compactness ratio is a measure used to assess how well areas were aggregated. Ideally, areas should be combined with other areas very close to them under the assumption that people tend to live closer to people with whom they are more similar. A circle is the most compact shape, so an area that is relatively round, like St. Lawrence County, New York (below right; compactness ratio = 0.71), will be more compact than an area that is long and narrow, like Cayuga County, New York (below left; compactness ratio = 0.18).

To calculate compactness ratio, the perimeter of the shape is calculated, then a circle with a circumference equal to the perimeter of the shape is drawn and its area is calculated. Next, the area of the shape is divided by the area of the circle. A highly compact shape will have a compactness ratio close to 1.



```{r compactness, out.width = '80%', fig.cap = 'Example of areas with high and low compactness, with overlaid circles', echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/compactness_example.png")


```
