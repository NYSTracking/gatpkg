# Geographic Aggregation Tool (GAT) v1.40 Change Log

Changes since January 2019 by Abigail Stamm.

> Below is a summary of differences between the R script for GAT released in 
> 2015 and the R package for GAT.

* Jan 2019 - Jan 2020:
    * Converted GAT to an R package and created accompanying help files, 
      examples, and vignettes.
    * Replaced statewide shapefile with two smaller shapefiles, hftown and 
      hftract.
    * Revised user input dialogs to allow the following:
        * maximum values
        * enforced boundaries
        * population weighting
        * exclusion criteria
        * optional KML file
        * reading in prior settings
    * Reordered GAT steps by section: user input, aggregation, mapping, and 
      file saving.
    * Converted all instances of svdialogs to tcltk.
    * Added help functionality and instructions to user input dialogs.
    * Reordered and restructured user input dialogs.
    * Added aggregation and summary information to maps and saved maps to PDF.
    * Added all settings and aggregation warnings to the log and a list of 
      created files to the console.
    * Rewrote KML code to use plotKML().
    * Rewrote and expanded quitting messaging to not crash GAT.
    * Standardized GAT-created variable names.
    * Made GAT ID length dynamic and consistent.



# Geographic Aggregation Tool (GAT) v1.34 Change Log

*(Release date: Aug 28, 2015)*

All changes prior to 2019 by Gwen Babcock.

> Changes prior to 2019 are listed below as they were entered in the program

> directly to specific versions. Comments appear to cover a mix of actual and
> planned changes. 

Changes:

* Jan 11, 2009 modified to add kml output
    * want to add capability to use two variables, and to merge from the
      highest down instead of lowest up
    * modify to use rgdal to read & write shapefile. It allows for projection
      info, but does have other limitations
    * Note: need to explicitly specify any libraries needed to run as a batch
      file, even those that would ordinarily be loaded by default
    * have problem with svDialog list.  We hypothesize that it can bomb if
      the list contains less than 3 items so modify the program accordingly
* April 20, 2009 modify to put compactness ratio measure in output data
* beta v5 June 21, 2010 change dialogs to add 'back' and 'help' options
* beta v6 July 15, 2010 add option to calculate rate, added popup when
  aggregation occurs to warn of slowness
    * added column with number of areas per region
    * add comparison of file size with memory availability
* beta v6.1 December 7, 2010 add conditional code to run gpclibPermit()
  function if needed
* December 10, 2010 change name to production version 1.0
* Dec 14, 2010 add merging option to most similar neighbor
* May 2011 v 1.2 bug fixes: check for errors in rate calculations and remove
  extra linking variable before re-exporting input shapfile
* October 27, 2011 found bug: will not export shapefile if field names are
  more than 10 characters
    * fix this by adding substring function to reduce variable name length if
      needed
* Sept 27,2012 modify to not standardize compactness ratios
* Feb 13, 2013 include version number and date in message, so it will be
  included in the log
* Aug 15, 2013 modify to work in R 3.0.1
    * That looks like it will take a lot of work
    * some packages I used before are no longer available, such as gpclib
    * svDialogs has changed - new function names
    * add progress dialog
    * also make KML output always, reprojecting if needed
    * need to wait for listboxes to be visible before populating them
* October 31, 2013 add code to make similarity based on a ratio, not a count
* November 5, 2013 change logic to merge in same specified boundary whenever
  possible, even if not contiguous
* November 7, 2013 test rates and similarity ratios for zero denominators.
  Don't allow them for similarity, but plot the rates while ignoring bad
  values
* November 8, 2013 change rate plot to show integers only, and use jenks
  (natural breaks) because quintiles was not working
* Feb 5, 2014 fix bugs in transformations - wrong formula to calculate UTM
  zones; rename version to v1.31
* June 13, 2014 add filter to open dialog to limit view to shapefiles.
* April 10, 2015 fix problem: limit dialog messages to 255 characters
* August 28, 2015 fix typo mergoption->mergeoption
* November 20, 2015 fix typo indentified->identified
