Examples to create:
* combineGATcrosswalks

Fixes and improvements to address:
* Pre-truncate variable names over 10 characters, especially "old_GATflag" and too-long rate names - done?
* Streamline warnings
* Add any "old_*" variables created/renamed to the log
* Where I alter par settings for maps, I revert them to default, but I should revert to user settings
* Add code to re-draw the progress bar if the user closes it
  * (me, repeatedly and accidentally, in testing)
  * still tinkering
* Add ability to use point level population-weighting data, and possibly raster (later)
* For all vignettes and help files, check image alt/descriptions
  * tutorial completed through end of user input section, including redoing most user input screenshots (except help, quit, errors)
* Opening any help dialog changes all background colors to white
* convert spdep and maptools to sf?
	note:   spdep works with sf
* shift some imports to suggests
  * tibble is giving me trouble no matter where I put it

Started
	* runGATprogram (rgdal, sp, maptools)
		- last (convert & test all functions, then combine everything here)
		- to test:
		  - population weighting
		  - writing kml
		  - error triggers
		  - randomly deleting progress bar
		- step 3: I think the flagging & variable naming codes are redundant

Completed - check examples
	* createGATregion (sp)
		- works for pop weighting - test all options
	* defineGATmerge (sp, spdep)
		- works for pop weighting - test all options
	* combineGATcrosswalks (rgdal)
		- export datasets to use as examples
		- or create datasets as part of examples?

Completed - these output layers - wait to copy
	* aggregateGATnb (spdep) - find sf equivalent?
	* weightGATmap (sp structure)
	* mergeGATareas (sp, maptools)
	* rankGATdistance (sp)
	* identifyGATfirstobs (sp structure)
	* importGATweights (sp)
	* calculateGATexclusions (sf structure)
	* calculateGATcompactness (sp, rgeos)
	* convertlatlong2UTM (sp)
	* zzz
	  - hftown & hfpop converted
	  - new aggregated and crosswalk objects created

Completed - none of these output layers - copy to master now?
	* writeGATlog (rgdal)
	* weightGATregion (sp structure)
	* convertlatlong2UTM (sp)
	* plotGATmaps (sp)
	* writeGATkml (sp)
	* plotGATcompare (sp)
	* checkGATvariabletypes
