To do list

Examples to create:
* combineGATcrosswalks

Fixes and improvements to address:
* Pre-truncate variable names over 10 characters, especially "old_GATflag" and too-long rate names
* Streamline warnings
* Add any "old_*" variables created/renamed to the log
* Where I alter par settings for maps, I revert them to default, but I should revert to user settings
* Add code to re-draw the progress bar if the user closes it (me, repeatedly and accidentally, in testing)
* Add ability to use point level population-weighting data, and possibly raster
* For all vignettes and help files, check image alt/descriptions
* Opening any help dialog changes all background colors to white
* convert all instances of rgdal/rgeos and if possible sp to sf, which is faster and better maintained
