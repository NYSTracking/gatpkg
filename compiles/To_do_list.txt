To do list

Examples to create:
* combineGATcrosswalks

Fixes and improvements to address:
* Pre-truncate variable names over 10 characters, especially "old_GATflag" and too-long rate names
* Streamline warnings
* Add any "old_*" variables created/renamed to the log
* Where I alter par settings for maps, I revert them to default, but I should revert to user settings
* Add code to re-draw the progress bar if the user closes it (me, repeatedly and accidentally, in testing)
* Add ability to use point level population-weighting data, and possibly raster
* For all vignettes and help files, check image alt/descriptions
* Opening any help dialog changes all background colors to white
* convert all instances of rgdal/rgeos and if possible sp to sf, which is faster and better maintained
	note:   spdep works with sf
			not sure if spdep and maptools need to be phased out, so ignore for now
	* runGATprogram (rgdal, sp, maptools) 
		- last (convert function by function and test, then combine everything here) 
		- updated to reflect option changes in defineGATmerge()
		- should run through defineGATmerge()
	* writeGATlog (rgdal)
	* writeGATkml (sp - will sf work?)
	* calculateGATcompactness (sp, rgeos)

	
	
Started, but buggy
	* mergeGATareas (sp, maptools)
		- barely started
	* createGATregion (sp) 
		- seems to work for pop weighting - test all options
	* defineGATmerge (sp, spdep) 
		- works fully for pop weighting, but test all options
		- may have fixed the crosswalk
	* combineGATcrosswalks (rgdal) 
		- started, but untested; rethought exported datasets to use as examples 
		- or create datasets as part of examples?
	* zzz - hftown & hfpop converted, then updated through line 85

Completed - need to fix before final integration?
	* rankGATdistance (sp) - function finished; test spdep in example
	* weightGATmap (sp structure) 
		- issue with createGATregion?

Completed - these output layers - wait to copy
	* identifyGATfirstobs (sp structure)
	* importGATweights (sp)
	* calculateGATexclusions (sf structure)
	* convertlatlong2UTM (sp)

Skippable?
	* aggregateGATnb - find sf equivalent? (spdep)

Completed - none of these output layers - should be able to copy now
	* weightGATregion (sp structure)
	* convertlatlong2UTM (sp)
	* plotGATmaps (sp)
	* plotGATcompare (sp)
	* checkGATvariabletypes
