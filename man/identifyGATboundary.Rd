\usage{
identifyGATboundary(
  data,
  step = 3,
  boundary = "NONE",

  check = FALSE,
  backopt = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame, intended to be read from a shapefile DBF.}

\item{step}{Integer step in the GAT program, for help reference.}

\item{boundary}{Boundary variable, if pre-selected. Defaults to "NONE",
which means no boundary selected.}

\item{borders}{Boolean denoting whether to enforce boundary. Defaults
to FALSE.}

\item{myvar}{The boundary variable, if pre-selected.}

\item{check}{The checkbox setting, if pre-selected. Currently does
not do anything.}

\item{backopt}{Boolean denoting whether to include the back button.}

\description{
This function opens a dialog window for the user to select a character
variable to prioritize larger geographic areas such as counties in
which to aggregate. The dialog window looks like this.

\if{html}{\figure{identifyGATboundary.png}{options: width="340px"
                  alt="Figure: Screenshot of dialog to select your boundary"}}

Select your desired boundary variable. If you do not want to include a
boundary, select "NONE". If you want to enforce the boundary, check the box
on the right as shown. Then click on one of the following buttons.
\itemize{
\item Click \code{Next} to continue to the next step.
\item Click \code{Cancel} to end GAT.
\item Click \code{Back} to return to the previous step.
\item Click \code{Help} to get further guidance and open this manual.

\details{
This function reads in a dataset and extracts the names of variables that
are (1) character and (2) not unique, since only these variables will be
suitable for defining larger geographic areas in GAT.
