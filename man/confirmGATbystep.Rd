\usage{
confirmGATbystep(
  gatvars,
  ratevars,
  mergevars,
  filevars,
  exclist,
  savekml,
  step = 0
)
}
\arguments{
\item{gatvars}{A list of objects created by the GAT tool. It contains the
strings aggregator1, aggregator2, myidvar, and boundary and
the numbers minvalue1 and minvalue2.}

\item{ratevars}{A list of objects needed to calculate rates. It contains
the strings ratename, numerator, and denominator and the
number multiplier.}

\item{mergevars}{A list of string objects needed to aggregate the areas in
GAT. It contains mergeopt1, similar1, and similar2.}

\item{filevars}{The names of shapefiles to read in and the name of the
shapefile to save to, all without extensions.}

\item{exclist}{A list of exclusion criteria to use when merging. It
contains strings representing the variables var1, var2,
and var3, and the conditions math1, math2, and math3, and
numbers representing cutoffs val1, val2, and val3 and the
number of excluded areas, flagsum.}

\item{savekml}{A boolean, whether or not to save a KML file.}

\item{step}{Integer step in the GAT program, for help reference.}
}
\description{
This function opens a dialog window for the user to select whether the
selected settings for GAT are correct. It provides the settings in list
format. The dialog window looks like this.

\if{html}{\figure{confirmGATdialog.png}{options: width="395px"
                  alt="Figure: Screenshot of dialog to confirm your settings"}}

Review your settings. Then click on one of the following buttons.
\itemize{
\item Click \code{Yes} to confirm the settings. In GAT, the next step is
starting the aggregation process.
\item Click \code{No} to reject the settings. In GAT, this returns you to step 1.
}
}
\details{
This function reads in the lists created during the user input portion of
the GAT tool. As such, it requires that the inputted lists contain the same
elements as those generated by the GAT tool.
